# Project TODO Checklist

Below is a thorough, high-level checklist you can use to stay organized and ensure you cover all aspects of your project. Mark each item as complete ([x]) once finished.

---

## 1. Project Initialization
- [ ] Set up a new repository (locally or on GitHub)
- [ ] Initialize a build system (e.g., Maven, Gradle) with the correct Java version
- [ ] Create a .gitignore file for build artifacts and IDE files
- [ ] Create a basic README.md describing the project and how to run it
- [ ] Verify the project builds and runs a minimal "Hello World" (or similar) successfully

## 2. Security & Authentication
- [ ] Add Spring Security (or equivalent) to the project
- [ ] Define user roles and privileges (e.g., ADMIN, USER)
- [ ] Integrate OAuth or basic authentication to protect endpoints
- [ ] Verify restricted endpoints cannot be accessed by unauthorized users
- [ ] Write unit tests or integration tests to confirm security workflow

## 3. Database Setup
- [ ] Select a database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Add connection dependencies and driver to the build file
- [ ] Configure database properties in application settings (url, username, password)
- [ ] Set up schema migrations with a tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase)
- [ ] Confirm the schema migrates correctly on application startup

## 4. Core Entity & Data Layer
- [ ] Create the main domain model/entity (e.g., Customer)
- [ ] Annotate entities with JPA/Hibernate annotations
- [ ] Implement repository classes or interfaces (e.g., JpaRepository)
- [ ] Write initial CRUD tests against the repository (unit or TestContainers-based)
- [ ] Verify data persistence logic is correct

## 5. Service & Business Logic
- [ ] Implement service classes that encapsulate business rules
- [ ] Write tests covering various edge cases (validation, error conditions)
- [ ] Ensure logging is present for key actions
- [ ] Add optional filtering/search logic if required

## 6. Controller & API Endpoints
- [ ] Create REST controllers to expose your business logic
- [ ] Define DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for input/output
- [ ] Implement CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Add request validation annotations to ensure data quality
- [ ] Write integration tests with MockMvc (or equivalent) to confirm behavior

## 7. Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Implement a global exception handler (e.g., @ControllerAdvice) to catch common errors
- [ ] Return consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Validate user inputs with annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Email)
- [ ] Confirm invalid requests trigger appropriate error responses
- [ ] Document error formats in your API docs (if applicable)

## 8. Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Decide on a logging library or framework (e.g., SLF4J, Logback)
- [ ] Set logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, etc.) appropriately
- [ ] Log important events (startups, errors, security events)
- [ ] Integrate monitoring or metrics (e.g., Spring Boot Actuator)

## 9. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Write unit tests for all key methods/functions
- [ ] Use integration tests (e.g., TestContainers) to verify database interactions
- [ ] Include security tests that confirm protected routes reject unauthorized access
- [ ] Aim for a reasonable code coverage threshold (e.g., 80%+)
- [ ] Address failing tests immediately to keep the build stable

## 10. Containerization & Deployment
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile for the application
- [ ] Prepare a docker-compose.yaml file to run the app + database together
- [ ] Verify the containerized environment runs locally
- [ ] Push images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
- [ ] Test deployment in a staging or production environment

## 11. Documentation & CI/CD
- [ ] Write or update API documentation (e.g., with Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Describe setup steps and usage guidelines in README or docs
- [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) that:
  - [ ] Builds the project
  - [ ] Runs tests with coverage
  - [ ] Performs a dependency or security check
  - [ ] Deploys artifacts on success or upon tag
- [ ] Keep documentation up-to-date with new features and changes

## 12. Final Review & Polishing
- [ ] Conduct a final review of code quality and architecture
- [ ] Check for any hard-coded credentials or sensitive info
- [ ] Optimize performance if needed (e.g., indexing, caching)
- [ ] Merge all feature branches into the main branch
- [ ] Tag a release and ensure everything is documented

Use this checklist as a living document, updating or refining it as the project evolves to ensure thorough coverage of each major project phase.
